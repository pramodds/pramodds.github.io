        If I used to be a writer in my native language (Russian), will it help me to apply those skills and to become a writer in English?

        Thoughts and expressions are best when expressed in mother tongue. <br>
<br>
Yes, you can definitely apply the skills of your native language to become an English writer. The skills related to the flow of thoughts that make the content, ideology, etc. But it takes time and extra effort to convert those thoughts to English words, esp when getting the right kind of word. It will definitely not be as easy as your native language.
<br>
I feel that it is best to continue to write in the mother tongue, and it will always have its value. Always have an attitude that your native language and English are equally good because there are many regional language books that are translated to English too. Mother tongue has been with you all the way till your present situation, and helped you in understanding and dealing with so many aspects of life. It's your opportunity to give something in return. Give the best!

        Are the Mahabharata and the Ramayana real?
      </div>
      <div class="blog-date">

        Let us consider a famous book which is based on an imaginary story. It can enjoy it's fame up to 5 or 10 years and then comes another competitor to take its position. It can be considered as the greatest book of the decade, but people cannot read the same book 5â€“6 times. Such books lack something in them which does not make them perennial.
<br>
Now let us consider Ramayana and Mahabharata. Mahabharata took place thousands of years ago and Ramayana was even long before Mahabharata. The stories still echo in the minds of crores of people amidst natural disasters, invasion of foreign dynasties, destruction of so many works, etc. Every time one reads these books, there's a new perspective and a deeper level of understanding. Sage Valmiki was a contemporary of Rama and Sage Veda Vyasa was a contemporary of Krishna, Pandavas, Kauravas etc. The deeper, detailed description of the characters involved and their existence related to previous stories, is it possible without any controversies to imagine such hundreds of terabytes of information?
<br>
Let us see few instances:
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Sage Valmiki asks Narada Muni about the existence of a character with so many qualities. Is it that Narada Muni, who appears in so many stories of Gods, an imaginary character created by Valmiki?</li>
  <li>Meeting of Rama and Parashurama, in Ramayana. Bhishma and Karna learning under the same Parashurama, in Mahabharata.</li>
  <li>Jambuvantha, who appears to be existing at the time of churning of the ocean and even during Vamana avatar of Vishnu appears in Ramayana.</li>
  <li>Instance of Bhima meeting Hanuman and Hanuman's words of supporting Arjuna in the battle by his presence on the flag of chariot.</li>
  <li>Description of the clan of Ikshvaku, River Ganga's birth, Bhishma being the son of Ganga, etc.</li>
  <li>So many such instances linked with previous Godly stories and characters. Vyasa Maharishi requests Lord Ganesha to write down Mahabharata while he dictates. Ganesha agrees on the condition that Sage Veda Vyasa should not stop in between. Is it possible to imagine such a huge story with so many sub stories and maintain that continuity in composing 1 lakh shlokas, apart from the grammar and selection of words?</li>
</ol>
<br>
It is the deeper observations of the characters, their actions, and their interaction with them coupled with their unmatchable authority over the language that has enabled two great Sages to write such amazing epics.
<br>
Only those stories that are for real can prove that it is possible to overcome the day to day difficulties of life by employing the same solutions as that adopted by the characters in it. Unreal stories are more like CGI graphics, they can't be implemented in day to day lives but can only serve as an entertainment. If the characters and their experiences were not real, there was no way that it could have survived for such a long time impacting on the lives of crores and crores of people.
<br>
I feel that they were very much real and serve in providing solutions for most (or almost all) of the problems (individual/ family/ relationships/ business/ politics and so on).

        Is chanting more rounds more important than chanting with quality?

        Simple as travelling from one location to another by walk and by a vehicle. The destination is same, but the time involved in reaching that destination changes.
<br>
Quality here means the devotion and faith with which the chanting is done. This greatly impacts, even Bhagavad-Gita stresses upon the state and presence of mind in the act.
<br>
Number takes a very long time to show it's impact. This situation is like walking towards the destination.
<br>
Both has its advantages, the way of Lord Krishna is unknown to small beings like us. Kamsa knew that the eighth child would be his destruction, yet he could not stop it. There lies the power of Krishna. So believing in him and doing our part is the best way.

        Why is there no country for Hindus?

        By "no country for Hindus" means "no country for Hinduism". Without a country and being the oldest of all, Hinduism has survived for so long! Do we have to think it really is a religion which survives on a platform of some country?
<br>
It is the way of living. No matter where a Hindu resides, Hinduism survives in his/her thoughts and principles of life. To see from a different perspective, every Hindu has a country (body). He nourishes it, keeps it clean, secures it from external disturbances and upgrades accordingly, etc.
<br>
Besides, a Hindu is more inquisitive about exploring the vast inner country apart from experiences of outer country. Maybe that's why they don't have a particular outer country for them.

        Everything in Hinduism isn't fiction.

        If Hinduism was a fiction, how come it has survived for thousands and thousands of years! It's not just a religion, it has been the way of living for so many people.
<br>
The scriptures that takes pride for representing Hinduism, were they written for fun? I don't think so, because rather than knowledge for making just money and name, they guide us with the most basic definitions to build a better life for ourselves as well as for the others.
<br>
Down the lane of 5000 years, people might call the world wars as fiction. If by chance, Google doesn't exist at that time, it might be one of Grandmother's tales. That doesn't mean it's false!
<br>
We haven't seen many of the great personalities like Ashoka, Alexander, Akbar, Socrates, etc but their works and prints of their achievements provide their proof of existence. Same way, Hinduism has its prints in the way of living of people, supported by so many books.
<br>
Just reading about a camera doesn't make one a great photographer, it has to be implemented. So I feel that understanding and implementing the essence and fragrance of Hinduism in one's life has more effect than thinking of it as a fiction or not.

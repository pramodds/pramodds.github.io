        "HELLO WORLD"<br>
    Life is Beautiful!!
    <br>
        Yes, an empty beginning, an empty ending, and millions of thoughts in between.
    Thoughts by silence, thoughts by actions, thoughts by emotions, thoughts by experiences... and vice versa... it goes on. Everything creates thoughts and thoughts create everything. Not a day goes by without a thought.
    <br>

        Just as a river cannot be stopped from flowing to the sea, thoughts are best when channelized to achieve a bigger goal. It can be a painting, a quote, a poem, a photograph, a blog, a dance form, etc. With the motive of expressing my thoughts that have crossed, crossing and yet to cross the mind, I am taking the first step in blogging. Since it started with a thought, I dedicate this blog to thoughts, inking them and also share a bit about myself.
        <br>
        I am Pramod DS, on the verge of scoring 25 years of this exciting journey, a Mechanical Engineer by profession and in person, an explorer interested to unravel oneself. A job would definitely help lead the life but a hobby helps living it. I love photography, vector art, solving Su-do-ku, listening to music, and many more. It is said that thoughts are better expressed in the mother tongue and I have fallen in love with mine, which is Kannada. I am no scholar in English. I am no scholar in Kannada too, but I enjoy writing poems using this medium. My affinity towards Sanskrit and the fact that Kannada is influenced by it interested me to read books of both the languages.
    <br>

    I see the future of my blogging in Kannada and English, and include in it the thoughts driven by reading, observing and experiencing. It is best to start and grow in the process than to wait for perfection in skills. So I seek from the readers, a broad mind to excuse the flaws they find, facilitate a learning path with feedbacks, suggestions, and comments, and also to share upon liking.
    <br>
    Caught by a thought, I start this journey of blogging. Let us care to share and share to care our thoughts.
    "THANK YOU WORLD"

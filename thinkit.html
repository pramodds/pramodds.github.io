        "HELLO WORLD"<br>
    Life is Beautiful!!
    <br>
        Yes, an empty beginning, an empty ending, and millions of thoughts in between.
    Thoughts by silence, thoughts by actions, thoughts by emotions, thoughts by experiences... and vice versa... it goes on. Everything creates thoughts and thoughts create everything. Not a day goes by without a thought.
    <br>

        Just as a river cannot be stopped from flowing to the sea, thoughts are best when channelized to achieve a bigger goal. It can be a painting, a quote, a poem, a photograph, a blog, a dance form, etc. With the motive of expressing my thoughts that have crossed, crossing and yet to cross the mind, I am taking the first step in blogging. Since it started with a thought, I dedicate this blog to thoughts, inking them and also share a bit about myself.
        <br>
        I am Pramod DS, on the verge of scoring 25 years of this exciting journey, a Mechanical Engineer by profession and in person, an explorer interested to unravel oneself. A job would definitely help lead the life but a hobby helps living it. I love photography, vector art, solving Su-do-ku, listening to music, and many more. It is said that thoughts are better expressed in the mother tongue and I have fallen in love with mine, which is Kannada. I am no scholar in English. I am no scholar in Kannada too, but I enjoy writing poems using this medium. My affinity towards Sanskrit and the fact that Kannada is influenced by it interested me to read books of both the languages.
    <br>

    I see the future of my blogging in Kannada and English, and include in it the thoughts driven by reading, observing and experiencing. It is best to start and grow in the process than to wait for perfection in skills. So I seek from the readers, a broad mind to excuse the flaws they find, facilitate a learning path with feedbacks, suggestions, and comments, and also to share upon liking.
    <br>
    Caught by a thought, I start this journey of blogging. Let us care to share and share to care our thoughts.
    "THANK YOU WORLD"

Art...
        <br>
        What is your first thought upon reading the word "ART"? 
        <br>
        Artist...
        <br>
        Who flashed in your mind upon reading the word "ARTIST"?
        <br>
        Conventional answer for the first question would be a painting, a dance form, an act, a song, a poem, a novel, a photograph etc and the respective doers viz., a painter, a dancer, an actor, a singer, a poet, a novelist, a photographer etc would be the answer to the next question.
<br>
        Perspectives, when observed from a neutral point, will always be right. It is just that the absence of knowledge wears the mask of wrongness. A brick has the shape of a rectangle, a square, and a cuboid for three persons viewing from the front, the side and the 3D respectively. All of them are right, right?  With this as my line of defense, I ink my perspectives on the above two big questions.
      <br>
        Just Imagine! A Universe, our world somewhere in that universe, us being unique among billions of people. That uniqueness is what makes each one of us artists. Art begins with the creation of the first cell in mother's womb and, realizing and savoring such small moments of art truly brings out the talents within us. Everything we see, everything we do and everything we think is an art, which leads us to the answer for 'who's an artist?'
        <br>
        <blockquote>Yes, an artist is every being and life itself is an art.</blockquote>
        <br>
        An artist is not a special kind of man but is the one whose actions are in accordance with his nature (swadharma). An artist is in tune with his nature when he is genuinely happy from within, not judging the world but only enhancing the quality of life. The only constraint here is that the actions must influence the upliftment of the society or at least the people around. The secret lies not in the way one reacts but responds to every moment, not in the way one sees but observes, not in the way one hears but listens, and more fundamentally not in the way one worries but thinks. 
        <br>
        The mind is a mirror that reflects life and springs the art. It is always the way we bond with our minds that help befriending it and keep the flow of art perennial. Cleaner the mirror, better is the reflection, and purity radiates in thoughts emerging from it. When thoughts are pure, art synchronizes with our true nature, and life finds its purpose. The only way to evaluate yourself in this process is to measure the pursuit of Happiness, at every moment.
        <br>
        The unknown power of heart manifests itself as art, happiness, love, peace, and satisfaction. The heart is the temple of art. Let us feel the artists in us, work with the art, from the heart. Let us become <strong>He'art'istic!</strong>
